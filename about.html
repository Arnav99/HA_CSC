        <h2> 1) Why did we choose the desgin home assignemt?</h2>
        <p>As we know the subject Client Side Computing is a very hands on subject meaning we can learn things very quickly if we
            try them out practically hence we chose the design Home Assignment for this subject
        </p>

        <h2> 2) What did we learn while making this Website?</h2>
        <p>We learnt a number of things while making this website, we also faced some challenges while making this wesbite 
            we couldn't have come across those if we hadn't tried making this site on our own. Some of the points learnt are shared below:
        <li>We learnt how to use CSS in a number of ways (inline,external) </li>
        <li>Learnt how to use tables in HTML</li> 
        <li>Bootstrap</li> 
        <li>Jquery and how can it make a website very powerful.</li> 
        <li>Responsive Website</li> 
        <li>Functions in Jquery</li> 
        <li>Delopying a website</li>
    </p>

    <h2> 3) Reason for choosing E-Cart as our project?</h2>
    <p>As this is a home Assignment we thought we could make something that will help us learn how to use a lot of Functions(Adding,Deleting items) 
        and also we could understand how the big e-commerce companies work with just a large database. So by choosing this project we now have a 
        diffrent view on e-commerce websites and understand how they function.
    </p>
